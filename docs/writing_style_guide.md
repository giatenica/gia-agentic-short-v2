5. **Results** (2-3 pages)
6. **Conclusion** (0.5-1 page)
7. **References**
8. **Online Appendix** (if needed)

### Section Content Guidelines

#### Abstract (Maximum 100 words)

The abstract must:
- State the research question
- Describe the methodology briefly
- Present key findings
- Indicate the contribution

**Template:**
```
This paper examines [research question] using [methodology/data]. 
We find that [main finding 1] and [main finding 2]. 
These results suggest [implication] and contribute to [literature stream].
```

**Example (75 words):**
```
This paper examines whether algorithmic trading improves market quality 
using high-frequency data from major exchanges between 2010 and 2023. 
We find that algorithmic trading reduces bid-ask spreads by 15% and 
increases price efficiency, measured by variance ratios. However, these 
benefits diminish during periods of market stress. Our results suggest 
that while algorithms enhance routine market functioning, they may 
amplify volatility during crises.
```

#### Introduction (1-2 pages for short papers)

Must include:
1. **Opening hook** (1-2 sentences): Why this matters
2. **Research question** (1 paragraph): What exactly you study
3. **Preview of findings** (1 paragraph): What you find
4. **Contribution** (1 paragraph): How this advances knowledge
5. **Literature positioning** (1-2 paragraphs): Where this fits
6. **Paper roadmap** (1-2 sentences): Structure of paper

**Introduction Template:**
```
[Hook: Economic motivation or puzzle]

[Research question: "This paper examines whether..."]

[Preview: "Using [data/method], we find that..."]

[Contribution: "Our findings contribute to [literature] by..."]

[Roadmap: "The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows..."]
```

#### Data and Methodology

Must include:
- Data sources with proper citations
- Sample period and construction

- Identification: [How causality is established]
```

#### Results

Must include:
- Main findings with economic interpretation
- Statistical significance and economic magnitude
- Robustness checks (can be abbreviated for short papers)
- Subsample analysis (if relevant)

**Presentation order:**
1. Summary statistics
2. Main regression results

4. Robustness checks
5. Heterogeneity analysis

#### Conclusion (0.5-1 page)

Must include:
- Summary of findings (2-3 sentences)

## 4. Writing Style

### Voice and Person

| Preference | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| **Active voice** | Preferred for clarity |
| **First person plural** | "We find..." (acceptable, use sparingly) |
| **Third person** | Preferred for formal presentation |
| **Passive voice** | Acceptable for objectivity in methods |

### Tense by Section

| Section | Tense | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Abstract | Present/Past | "This paper examines..." |
| Introduction | Present | "We investigate whether..." |
| Literature Review | Present | "Fama (1970) shows..." |
| Data/Methods | Past | "We collected data from..." |
| Results | Present/Past | "Table 3 reports..." |
| Conclusion | Present | "Our findings indicate..." |

### Academic Language

**Use:**

- "We document that..."
- "The evidence indicates..."

**Avoid:**
- "It is obvious that..."

- "Of course..."
- "Interestingly..." (overused)
- Colloquialisms and contractions

### Hedging Language

Appropriate uncertainty expressions:
- "The results suggest..."
- "These findings are consistent with..."
- "One interpretation is..."
- "The evidence points toward..."

### Precision

- Use specific numbers: "a 15% increase" not "a large increase"
- Define all variables explicitly
- Avoid vague terms: "many," "various," "some"
- Quantify economic magnitude

### Banned Words and Phrases

Per project guidelines, avoid:
```
delve, realm, harness, unlock, tapestry, paradigm, cutting-edge, 
revolutionize, landscape, potential, findings, intricate, showcasing, 
crucial, pivotal, surpass, meticulously, vibrant, unparalleled, 
underscore, leverage, synergy, innovative, game-changer, testament, 
commendable, meticulous, highlight, emphasize, boast, groundbreaking, 
align, foster, showcase, enhance, holistic, garner, accentuate,

```

**Use instead:**
- "examine" instead of "delve"
- "use" instead of "utilize"
- "new" instead of "novel"
- "important" instead of "crucial"
- "shows" instead of "showcases"

## 7. Short Article Guidelines

### What Makes a Short Article

JFQA explicitly welcomes "short and impactful papers" published as regular articles.

**Ideal characteristics:**
- Single, focused research question
- Clean identification strategy
- Clear economic contribution
- Concise presentation

### Length Guidelines

| Element | Full Paper | Short Paper |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Total pages | 30-45 | 5-10 |
| Abstract | 100 words | 50-75 words |
| Introduction | 3-5 pages | 1-2 pages |
| Literature | Separate section | Integrated |
| Methodology | Detailed | Essential only |
| Results | Multiple tables | 2-3 tables |
| Robustness | In paper | Online appendix |
| References | 40-60 | 20-30 |

### What to Abbreviate

1. **Literature review**: Integrate into introduction; cite only essential papers
2. **Methodology**: Reference prior papers for standard techniques
3. **Robustness checks**: Move to online appendix
4. **Institutional background**: Minimize unless essential
5. **Variable definitions**: Brief in text, detailed in online appendix

### Writing Concisely

1. **Lead with results**: State main finding in first paragraph
2. **One idea per paragraph**: Clear topic sentences
3. **Eliminate redundancy**: Each sentence adds new information
4. **Tables carry weight**: Let tables present detailed statistics
5. **Tight prose**: Remove filler words

**Before:**
```
In this paper, we investigate and examine the relationship between 
algorithmic trading and market quality. We use a comprehensive dataset 
that includes detailed transaction-level data from multiple exchanges.
```

**After:**
```
We examine whether algorithmic trading improves market quality using 
transaction-level data from major exchanges.
```

### Online Appendix

Use for:
- Detailed variable definitions
- Additional robustness tests
- Extended summary statistics
- Mathematical derivations
- Data cleaning procedures
