      "methodology_justification": "# Methodology Justification\n\nThe difference-in-differences (DiD) approach is particularly well-suited to address the methodological challenges inherent in disentangling voting rights premiums from liquidity effects in dual-class share structures. While existing literature has employed matched pair analysis to control for fundamental value differences between GOOG and GOOGL shares, and regression analysis with liquidity controls to statistically separate these effects, these approaches struggle with the endogeneity problem whereby voting rights and liquidity characteristics may be jointly determined or systematically correlated (as documented in studies showing non-voting shares frequently exhibit superior liquidity). The DiD framework overcomes this limitation by exploiting temporal variation in treatment intensity—specifically, exogenous shocks such as regulatory changes, control contests, or corporate governance events that differentially affect the value of voting rights while leaving liquidity characteristics relatively unchanged. This identification strategy, which has proven effective in event study methodologies examining regulatory changes affecting dual-class structures, allows for causal inference by comparing the evolution of option price differentials between voting and non-voting shares before and after such events, effectively using the pre-event period to establish a counterfactual baseline that accounts for persistent liquidity differences.\n\nThe DiD approach directly addresses the contribution opportunity identified in the literature for high-frequency analysis of option market microstructure by enabling examination of whether GOOG/GOOGL option price differentials widen during periods of heightened control uncertainty (consistent with voting value) or remain stable and correlated primarily with liquidity measures. By comparing changes in option price differentials around corporate events known to amplify voting premiums—such as takeover attempts or proxy fights documented in prior research—against control periods, this methodology can provide cleaner identification than cross-sectional regression approaches that suffer from multicollinearity between voting and liquidity proxies. The primary limitation of this approach is the requirement for clearly identifiable exogenous events that affect voting rights value, and the potential for confounding contemporaneous shocks. These concerns will be addressed through careful event selection criteria, robustness checks using placebo events, and parallel trends testing to verify that treatment and control groups (or pre- and post-event periods) exhibited similar trajectories prior to the intervention, thereby strengthening the causal interpretation of observed differential changes in option pricing patterns.",

      "state_of_field": "The literature on dual-class share structures has evolved considerably, with recent scholarship examining how voting rights premiums manifest across different securities and market contexts. Traditional research established that voting shares typically trade at premiums relative to non-voting shares, with explanations ranging from private benefits of control to minority shareholder expropriation concerns. However, the field has increasingly recognized that observed price differentials may reflect multiple factors beyond pure voting rights value, including liquidity differences, regulatory environments, and market microstructure effects. The seminal work on expropriation of minority shareholders in East Asia and subsequent studies on dual-class structures globally have provided foundational understanding of control premiums, yet questions remain about how these premiums are accurately measured and whether they persist consistently across derivative securities.\n\nRecent research has expanded beyond equity markets to examine how voting rights value appears in options markets, with particular attention to the GOOG/GOOGL case as a natural experiment. Studies have begun to disentangle voting rights premiums from liquidity effects, recognizing that non-voting shares often exhibit higher trading volumes and tighter bid-ask spreads. The literature now acknowledges that option pricing for dual-class shares presents unique challenges, as traditional option pricing models assume homogeneous underlying assets. Contemporary work increasingly employs sophisticated empirical methods to isolate voting rights value embedded in option prices, though consensus on appropriate methodologies remains elusive. The field has also witnessed growing interest in how regulatory changes and corporate governance mechanisms affect the valuation differential between share classes.\n\n## 2. KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Voting premiums vary substantially across jurisdictions and time periods**, with evidence suggesting that regulatory environments, ownership concentration, and corporate governance quality significantly influence the magnitude of observed differentials between voting and non-voting shares. Studies document premiums ranging from negligible to over 20% depending on context.\n\n- **Liquidity differences often confound voting rights valuation**, as non-voting shares frequently exhibit superior liquidity characteristics including higher trading volumes, lower bid-ask spreads, and greater market depth. This liquidity advantage can offset or even reverse the theoretical premium that voting shares should command.\n\n- **Option markets provide unique insights into voting rights value** because options on dual-class shares allow researchers to observe market participants' expectations about future price differentials while controlling for certain confounding factors. However, the value of voting rights embedded in option prices appears smaller and less consistent than in underlying equity markets.\n\n- **Corporate events and control contests significantly amplify voting premiums**, with research documenting that the value of voting rights increases substantially during takeover attempts, proxy fights, and other situations where control becomes contested. Outside these events, voting premiums may be minimal or undetectable.\n\n- **Market efficiency in pricing dual-class structures remains contested**, with some studies finding that markets efficiently incorporate voting rights value while others document persistent mispricings, particularly in derivative markets where complexity may impede accurate valuation.\n\n## 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n- **Private Benefits of Control Theory**: This framework posits that voting shares command premiums because they provide access to private benefits that controlling shareholders can extract from the firm. The magnitude of the premium reflects market expectations about the present value of these extractable benefits, which vary based on legal protections for minority shareholders and corporate governance quality.\n\n- **Liquidity Premium Theory**: Drawing from asset pricing literature, this framework suggests that securities with superior liquidity characteristics should trade at premiums relative to otherwise identical but less liquid securities. When applied to dual-class shares, this theory predicts that higher-liquidity non-voting shares may trade at premiums despite lacking voting rights, creating tension with control-based theories.\n\n- **Option Pricing Extensions for Heterogeneous Underlyings**: Recent theoretical work has adapted Black-Scholes and related option pricing models to accommodate dual-class share structures, recognizing that options on voting versus non-voting shares represent claims on fundamentally different securities. These frameworks attempt to decompose option prices into components attributable to voting rights versus other factors.\n\n- **Market Microstructure and Price Discovery**: This framework examines how trading mechanisms, information asymmetry, and market participant behavior affect price formation in dual-class securities. It provides theoretical grounding for understanding how liquidity differences emerge and persist between share classes and how these differences propagate to derivative markets.\n\n## 4. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES\n\n- **Event Study Methodology**: Researchers commonly employ event studies around regulatory changes, dual-class unifications, or control contests to identify causal effects on voting premiums. Strengths include clear identification of exogenous shocks; limitations include potential confounding events and limited generalizability beyond specific event windows. Studies examining regulatory events affecting dual-class structures have proven particularly informative.\n\n- **Matched Pair Analysis**: Comparing voting and non-voting shares of the same firm controls for fundamental value differences, allowing researchers to isolate voting rights premiums. This approach has been applied extensively to equity markets and increasingly to options markets. However, this method struggles to separate voting value from liquidity effects when both factors vary systematically between share classes.\n\n- **Option Pricing Model Decomposition**: Recent studies extract implied voting rights value by comparing observed option prices for voting versus non-voting shares with theoretical prices from modified Black-Scholes or GARCH models. This approach offers direct measurement of market-implied voting premiums but requires strong assumptions about model specification and may be sensitive to liquidity-induced pricing errors in options markets.\n\n- **Regression Analysis with Liquidity Controls**: Researchers increasingly employ panel regressions that include explicit controls for liquidity measures (bid-ask spreads, trading volume, price impact) alongside voting rights indicators. This approach attempts to statistically disentangle voting and liquidity effects, though multicollinearity between these factors presents ongoing challenges and the choice of liquidity proxies significantly affects results.\n\n## 5. CONTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES\n\n- **High-frequency analysis of option market microstructure** could provide finer-grained evidence on whether GOOG/GOOGL option price differentials reflect voting value or liquidity by examining intraday patterns, order flow dynamics, and price discovery processes. Such analysis could reveal whether differentials widen during periods of heightened control uncertainty or instead correlate primarily with liquidity shocks.\n\n- **Machine learning approaches to decompose voting and liquidity effects** represent an underexplored methodological frontier. Techniques such as random forests or neural networks could identify non-linear relationships and interactions between voting rights, liquidity measures, and option pricing that traditional regression approaches miss, potentially resolving conflicting findings in existing literature.\n\n- **Cross-market comparison of dual-class option pricing** across different dual-class firms and international markets could establish whether patterns observed in GOOG/GOOGL generalize or represent idiosyncratic features of this particular case. Such comparative analysis would strengthen external validity and identify contextual factors that moderate the relationship between voting rights and option prices.\n\n- **Examination of options market behavior during specific corporate governance events** (shareholder votes, board elections, governance proposals) could provide natural experiments to test whether option price differentials respond to changes in the expected value of voting rights. This event-based approach would offer cleaner identification than cross-sectional comparisons while addressing causality concerns that plague much existing research.",

      "full_synthesis": "# Literature Synthesis: Voting Rights Value vs. Liquidity in Dual-Class Share Options\n\n## 1. STATE OF THE FIELD\n\nThe literature on dual-class share structures has evolved considerably, with recent scholarship examining how voting rights premiums manifest across different securities and market contexts. Traditional research established that voting shares typically trade at premiums relative to non-voting shares, with explanations ranging from private benefits of control to minority shareholder expropriation concerns. However, the field has increasingly recognized that observed price differentials may reflect multiple factors beyond pure voting rights value, including liquidity differences, regulatory environments, and market microstructure effects. The seminal work on expropriation of minority shareholders in East Asia and subsequent studies on dual-class structures globally have provided foundational understanding of control premiums, yet questions remain about how these premiums are accurately measured and whether they persist consistently across derivative securities.\n\nRecent research has expanded beyond equity markets to examine how voting rights value appears in options markets, with particular attention to the GOOG/GOOGL case as a natural experiment. Studies have begun to disentangle voting rights premiums from liquidity effects, recognizing that non-voting shares often exhibit higher trading volumes and tighter bid-ask spreads. The literature now acknowledges that option pricing for dual-class shares presents unique challenges, as traditional option pricing models assume homogeneous underlying assets. Contemporary work increasingly employs sophisticated empirical methods to isolate voting rights value embedded in option prices, though consensus on appropriate methodologies remains elusive. The field has also witnessed growing interest in how regulatory changes and corporate governance mechanisms affect the valuation differential between share classes.\n\n## 2. KEY FINDINGS\n\n- **Voting premiums vary substantially across jurisdictions and time periods**, with evidence suggesting that regulatory environments, ownership concentration, and corporate governance quality significantly influence the magnitude of observed differentials between voting and non-voting shares. Studies document premiums ranging from negligible to over 20% depending on context.\n\n- **Liquidity differences often confound voting rights valuation**, as non-voting shares frequently exhibit superior liquidity characteristics including higher trading volumes, lower bid-ask spreads, and greater market depth. This liquidity advantage can offset or even reverse the theoretical premium that voting shares should command.\n\n- **Option markets provide unique insights into voting rights value** because options on dual-class shares allow researchers to observe market participants' expectations about future price differentials while controlling for certain confounding factors. However, the value of voting rights embedded in option prices appears smaller and less consistent than in underlying equity markets.\n\n- **Corporate events and control contests significantly amplify voting premiums**, with research documenting that the value of voting rights increases substantially during takeover attempts, proxy fights, and other situations where control becomes contested. Outside these events, voting premiums may be minimal or undetectable.\n\n- **Market efficiency in pricing dual-class structures remains contested**, with some studies finding that markets efficiently incorporate voting rights value while others document persistent mispricings, particularly in derivative markets where complexity may impede accurate valuation.\n\n## 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n- **Private Benefits of Control Theory**: This framework posits that voting shares command premiums because they provide access to private benefits that controlling shareholders can extract from the firm. The magnitude of the premium reflects market expectations about the present value of these extractable benefits, which vary based on legal protections for minority shareholders and corporate governance quality.\n\n- **Liquidity Premium Theory**: Drawing from asset pricing literature, this framework suggests that securities with superior liquidity characteristics should trade at premiums relative to otherwise identical but less liquid securities. When applied to dual-class shares, this theory predicts that higher-liquidity non-voting shares may trade at premiums despite lacking voting rights, creating tension with control-based theories.\n\n- **Option Pricing Extensions for Heterogeneous Underlyings**: Recent theoretical work has adapted Black-Scholes and related option pricing models to accommodate dual-class share structures, recognizing that options on voting versus non-voting shares represent claims on fundamentally different securities. These frameworks attempt to decompose option prices into components attributable to voting rights versus other factors.\n\n- **Market Microstructure and Price Discovery**: This framework examines how trading mechanisms, information asymmetry, and market participant behavior affect price formation in dual-class securities. It provides theoretical grounding for understanding how liquidity differences emerge and persist between share classes and how these differences propagate to derivative markets.\n\n## 4. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES\n\n- **Event Study Methodology**: Researchers commonly employ event studies around regulatory changes, dual-class unifications, or control contests to identify causal effects on voting premiums. Strengths include clear identification of exogenous shocks; limitations include potential confounding events and limited generalizability beyond specific event windows. Studies examining regulatory events affecting dual-class structures have proven particularly informative.\n\n- **Matched Pair Analysis**: Comparing voting and non-voting shares of the same firm controls for fundamental value differences, allowing researchers to isolate voting rights premiums. This approach has been applied extensively to equity markets and increasingly to options markets. However, this method struggles to separate voting value from liquidity effects when both factors vary systematically between share classes.\n\n- **Option Pricing Model Decomposition**: Recent studies extract implied voting rights value by comparing observed option prices for voting versus non-voting shares with theoretical prices from modified Black-Scholes or GARCH models. This approach offers direct measurement of market-implied voting premiums but requires strong assumptions about model specification and may be sensitive to liquidity-induced pricing errors in options markets.\n\n- **Regression Analysis with Liquidity Controls**: Researchers increasingly employ panel regressions that include explicit controls for liquidity measures (bid-ask spreads, trading volume, price impact) alongside voting rights indicators. This approach attempts to statistically disentangle voting and liquidity effects, though multicollinearity between these factors presents ongoing challenges and the choice of liquidity proxies significantly affects results.\n\n## 5. CONTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES\n\n- **High-frequency analysis of option market microstructure** could provide finer-grained evidence on whether GOOG/GOOGL option price differentials reflect voting value or liquidity by examining intraday patterns, order flow dynamics, and price discovery processes.

Unlike existing approaches that treat liquidity as a control variable or omit it entirely, our framework simultaneously estimates both components while allowing their relative contributions to evolve dynamically across moneyness levels, maturities, and market conditions. By applying Kalman filtering techniques to a comprehensive dataset of matched option pairs, we provide the first systematic decomposition that quantifies how much of the observed price differential reflects voting rights value versus liquidity effects at each point in time. This methodological approach addresses a fundamental identification challenge in the dual-class share literature and offers insights into how the economic significance of voting rights varies with option characteristics and corporate governance events.",

We find companies with staggered boards have a higher voting premium. Exploiting plausibly exogenous court rulings, we confirm that weakening the effectiveness of staggered boards decreases the voting premium. Given that the voting premium reflects private benefits consumption and associated managerial inefficiencies, our findings are consistent with the entrenchment view of staggered boards. Analyzing the cross-sectional heterogeneity in our sample, we find the entrenchment effect of staggered boards to be particularly pronounced for firms in noncompetitive industries and for mature firms.

This effect is amplified by upcoming shareholder meetings, activist involvement, and subpar firm performance, yet mitigated by higher insider ownership.

We find that risk-adjusted stock returns increase (decline) significantly on days surrounding such actions that increase the probability of banning (allowing) dual-class shares. The stock market reaction varies across firms systematically suggesting that there is a negative view of dual classes in firms with entrenched managers and is viewed somewhat positively when there is a benefit to protecting management. Dual-class structures do not harm shareholders in very young firms.",

        "snippet": "The motivations and impacts of dual‐class voting structures are controversial and have been extensively studied. In this paper, we apply a new methodology to study the impact of dual‐class voting that avoids the endogeneity issues of other studies. Specifically, we rely on market‐wide stock market reactions to multiple regulatory events to show that risk‐adjusted stock returns rise (fall) in response to events that decrease (increase) the probability of adopting dual‐class shares. Across firms, this reaction varies systematically and sensibly with proxies for managerial flexibility or entrenchment and overall suggests that investors favor dual‐class shares in research‐intensive and well‐governed firms. The improved method of analysis strengthens the results of prior studies and reconciles the theories of managerial flexibility versus entrenchment. We conclude by arguing that a one‐size‐fits‐all policy that bans dual‐class shares would reduce research output, firm value, and profitability.",

This study investigates the potential harm of such structures by examining the identity and returns of minority shareholders. We find that sophisticated investors predominantly hold low‐voting shares. Furthermore, outside shareholders earn a positive risk premium rather than suffering low returns, consistent with the hypothesis that market prices compensate for the risk associated with dual‐class structures. Our analysis reveals that such structures are confounded with family control, which is present in 89% of dual‐class firms in the Russell 3000. Interestingly, single‐class firms with family shareholders also enjoy positive abnormal returns, implying minority shareholders care more about the presence of a controlling shareholder than a specific voting structure. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on restricting dual‐class structures by highlighting the complex relationship between ownership, control, and shareholder returns.",

        "snippet": "The Constitutional Court (MK) Decision Number 116/PUU-XXI/2023 is an important basis for evaluating the parliamentary threshold policy in the Indonesian election system. This provision requires political parties to obtain a minimum of 4% of valid national votes in order to get seats in the People's Representative Council (DPR). Although it aims to coordinate the party system and increase government stability, this regulation raises various problems, especially related to political representation and electoral justice. The Constitutional Court, in its decision, stated that the parliamentary threshold remains in effect for the 2024 Election but must be evaluated before the 2029 Election so that it is more proportional and does not harm the constitutional rights of voters. This study uses a normative legal method with a regulatory and contextual approach. The results of the study show that the application of the 4% threshold resulted in the loss of around 17.3 million votes in the 2024 Election, which has an impact on limited political representation for small parties and their voters. The Constitutional Court, in its decision, emphasized the need to revise this regulation to be fairer and reflect the principle of people's sovereignty. Some proposed policy alternatives include the implementation of a height threshold, a proportionality-based calculation model, and a revision of the DPR seat allocation system to reduce wasted votes. The parliamentary threshold system needs to be improved with a more objective data-based approach to reflect the principles of electoral fairness better. The evaluation of this rule is a step to realize a more representative, transparent, and democratic electoral system for the future of Indonesian politics",

The recent mid-stream recapitalization of Google introducing a class of non-voting shares raises certain questions about controlling shareholder opportunism and the adequacy of our current system in protecting the rights of public shareholders.

        "snippet": "\n The London Stock Exchange’s (LSE’s) approach to dual-class shares has meandered over the decades. Dual-class shares give privileged insiders the facility to hold voting rights that are disproportionately high compared to their economic ownership interests in the company. At one time, the exchange welcomed dual-class shares with open arms, before first informally prohibiting them, then explicitly proscribing the structure from the premium tier, the most prestigious segment of the exchange. More recently, in the shadow of what some have described as a failing stock market, the UK regulator’s attitude to dual-class shares has softened. A tentative 2021 relaxation to permit what this paper describes as ‘dual-class shares lite’ gave way to 2024 reforms that foster the admission of genuine dual-class shares companies, described herein as ‘dual-class shares full fat’. This article outlines the most recent set of UK reforms on dual-class shares, critically evaluating the conditions attached to the listing of such firms. It finds that, overall, the 2024 reforms rectify the flaws of the 2021 modifications, and will be more attractive to founders of innovative, high-growth companies. However, a concomitant relaxation of related-party transaction regulations that has also taken place could portend a dual-class shares storm around the corner.\n",

Hence, the primary aim of this study is to examine the impact of dual-class share structures, shareholder engagement, and corporate governance on unequal shareholders’ voting rights in publicly listed companies in China, Malaysia, and Germany with a particular focus on the moderating role of regulatory pressure. The study collected empirical data from shareholders of publicly listed companies through structured questionnaires. Additionally, the study employed Smart-PLS to assess data reliability and analyze the relationships between key variables. The results indicated that dual-class share structures and shareholder engagement have a positive association with unequal shareholders’ voting rights whereas corporate governance exhibits a negative relationship with unequal shareholders’ voting rights. Furthermore, the findings revealed that regulatory pressure plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between dual-class share structures, shareholder engagement, corporate governance, and unequal shareholders’ voting rights, particularly in the contexts of China and Germany. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers offering guidance on formulating policies aimed at reducing unequal voting rights among shareholders. Specifically, it suggests that eliminating dual-class share structures, addressing ineffective shareholder engagement, and implementing robust corporate governance measures can contribute to a more balanced and equitable voting system within public companies.",

        "snippet": "Abstract Loyalty voting structures (LVS) are designed to provide registered shareholders with multiple voting rights following a specified holding period. In theory this concept strikes a balance between dual-class structures (DCS), which enshrine founder control, and open structures that allow for control challenges. LVS entail a single class of shares, enabling all shareholders to possess multiple votes without incurring additional costs, while also limiting the privilege through a transfer sunset provision. Notably, LVS also preserve a key control advantage of DCS for founders, as they minimize the likelihood of control challenges through contested board elections. However, in practice LVS distinguish between bearer shares that are fully fungible and registered shares that allow the company to verify the holding period. Institutional shareholders often find it impossible to register their shares, thereby being deprived of multiple voting rights. Consequently, LVS effectively function as a mechanism to enhance control akin to dual-class structures. Transforming loyalty voting structures into a better dual class for institutional shareholders would require some legal and significant procedural modifications.",

The data show that firms choosing voting-right structures that favor management face a significant and persistent valuation discount in the market, even after controlling for the endogenous choice to go public with dual-class equity. In this section we examine the market's pricing of dual- and single-class IPOs by testing for systematic differences in valuation ratios across the different firm types. In this section, we try to assess whether the market's discount of dual-class shares is consistent with the future stock and operating performance of these firms. If dual-class voting structures entrench managers, and if shareholders discount dual-class shares as a result, then we should expect the market to react positively when firms eliminate the Class B shares owned by insiders. This paper provides evidence that investors discount the shares of dual-class IPOs relative to newly public single-class firms.",

This premium features the control power mechanism and may be directly related to appropriating private benefits.3 The empirical appraisal of market voting premiums seeks to assess its magnitude, analyze its determinants, and provide an answer to the issue of private benefits and agency costs.

Our findings suggest that minority shareholders care about the presence of a controlling shareholder rather than a particular voting structure. Minority shareholders receive compensation via higher expected returns for bearing the associated control-right risk. **Keywords:** Dual-class shares, voting rights, controlling shareholders, minority shareholders, monitoring. #### Temple University - Department of Finance ( email) ). #### National University of Singapore - Dept of Accounting ( email) ). #### DePaul University - Kellstadt Graduate School of Business ( email) ). #### Independent - *affiliation not provided to SSRN*. #### About SSRN.",

        "snippet": "This study empirically examined the performance of some popular option pricing models in the valuation of the CSI 500 ETF index options. The CSI 500 index tracks the mid-to-small cap equities in the Chinese A-share market. In particular, this study analyzed the market data from September 2023 to August 2024 to compare the performance of the Black-Scholes model and GARCH-variant models. Although specific characteristics of the CSI 500 index, including higher volatility and lower liquidity, theoretically may favor more sophisticated time-series models, this study finds the Black-Scholes model produces more accurate option valuation across different maturity ranges. This superior performance is most pronounced for options with shorter time to maturity and remains robust in out-of-sample data testing. All models produce better prediction accuracy for shorter-dated options. These results show that, presently market microstructure and market participant factors in the Chinese mid-cap equity options market may be dominating theoretical considerations in selecting the optimal option pricing methodology. This study serves as the first to comprehensively evaluate the performance of option pricing models in the Chinese mid-cap index options market, hence providing practical insights to market participants and regulators in various emerging derivatives markets.",

        "snippet": "This paper extends an option-theoretic approach to estimate liquidity spreads for corporate bonds. Inspired by Longstaff's equity market framework and subsequent work by Koziol and Sauerbier on risk-free zero-coupon bonds, the model views liquidity as a look-back option. The model accounts for the interplay of risk-free rate volatility and credit risk. A numerical analysis highlights the impact of these factors on the liquidity spread, particularly for bonds with different maturities and credit ratings. The methodology is applied to estimate the liquidity spread for unquoted bonds, with a specific case study on the Republic of Italy's debt, leveraging market data to calibrate model parameters and classify liquid versus illiquid emissions. This approach provides a robust tool for pricing illiquid bonds, emphasizing the importance of marketability in debt security valuation.",

        "snippet": "Time-bound stablecoins are DeFi assets that temporarily tokenize traditional securities during market off-hours, enabling continuous cross-market liquidity. We introduce the Liquidity-of-Time Premium (TLP): the extra return or cost of providing liquidity when the primary market is closed. We build a no-arbitrage pricing model that yields a band for fair values over different expiries, and a dynamic risk-control mechanism that adjusts loan-to-value (LTV) ratios in real time to keep TLP within a target range. Our analysis blends financial engineering (no-arbitrage conditions, option-style pricing) with empirical finance (event studies on cross-listed stocks and futures) to measure TLP under time-zone frictions. We define TLP formally, derive closed-form expressions for its term structure under idealized assumptions, and simulate scenarios that vary volatility and collateralization. We then propose an LTV policy that raises or lowers collateral to expand or curtail time-bound stablecoin supply, analogous to a central bank adjusting rates to defend a peg. We outline empirical proxies for TLP, including ADR premiums, overseas index futures versus cash index divergence, and pre-market versus official close gaps. Results show that TLP grows with closure length and volatility, yet can be contained by adaptive LTV. We provide backtests and figures (term-structure curves, capital-efficiency versus tail-risk trade-offs, time-liquidity heatmaps) and discuss protocol design (vault structure, closing-price oracles, on-chain auction liquidations). The findings position time-bound stablecoins as a tool to reduce temporal market inefficiencies and inform future research and deployment.",

Most of the firms with exchange-traded options have large market capitalization and are actively traded. It is a puzzle why it takes days and sometimes weeks for stock price to reflect the information contained in option trades. We conjecture that voting rights consideration may contribute to the delayed stock price response to option information. More specifically, we hypothesize that the delay is much longer during the period when shareholder voting is required to resolve contentious corporate matters. We analyze a sample of 1,842 special shareholder meetings between 2003 and 2015 and find that the predictability of option volume and volatility spread is much stronger in the weeks around special shareholder meetings (i.e., the event window). The Fama-MacBeth regression analysis shows that while the predictability of volatility spread is significant both within and outside the event window, the predictability of option volume is significant only within the event window. We contribute to the literature by offering a new explanation of the delayed stock price response to option information and documenting a significant asset pricing effect of voting rights.",

By employing high-frequency microstructure analysis and machine learning decomposition techniques to examine GOOGL and GOOG option pricing patterns during corporate governance events, this research disentangles voting rights effects from liquidity effects in derivatives markets. The findings will inform options traders seeking to price dual-class securities accurately, corporate finance scholars studying the valuation of control rights, and regulators evaluating the market efficiency implications of dual-class share structures.\n\nResearch Question Refinement:\nOriginal: This paper examines whether the observed price differential between GOOGL (voting) and GOOG (non-voting) options reflects voting rights value or liquidity differences.\nRefined: Does the GOOGL-GOOG option price differential vary systematically with liquidity metrics (bid-ask spreads, trading volume, open interest) after controlling for moneyness and time to expiration, and if so, can this variation explain the observed differential better than voting rights value alone?\n\nNext step: Gap analysis and research planning.",
